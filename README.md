# Node.js Certification Course - Scaler ðŸš€

This repository documents my learnings and projects completed during the **Node.js Certification Course** by **Scaler**.  

## Overview  
This course focused on building robust and scalable backend applications using **Node.js** and **MongoDB**, covering key concepts essential for modern backend development.  

## Tasks Completed  
### 1. API Development  
- Built RESTful APIs with **Node.js** and **Express.js**.  
- Designed endpoints to handle GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.  

### 2. CRUD Operations with MongoDB  
- Connected Node.js applications to **MongoDB**.  
- Implemented **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete** functionalities.  
- Performed data validation for database integrity.  

### 3. Asynchronous JavaScript  
- Mastered **Promises**, **async/await**, and the event loop.  
- Optimized application performance by leveraging non-blocking I/O.  

### 4. Middleware in Express.js  
- Developed custom middleware to handle tasks like:  
  - Logging requests.  
  - Error handling.  
  - User authentication and authorization.  

### 5. Data Validation  
- Used **Mongoose** to enforce schemas and validate data before storing it in the database.  

### 6. Comprehensive Backend Projects  
- Built scalable backend applications by integrating all the above concepts.  

## What's Next?  
- Applying these skills in real-world projects.  
- Exploring advanced Node.js concepts like microservices and WebSockets.
